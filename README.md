- 👋 Hi,<br/> My name is Temi..
I am an enthusiast and maintainer. I'm learning a lot from the open-source community and love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happens through open-source.

 <br/>
 
- 🌱 I work with Swift for UIKit and SwiftUI and Dart for Flutter. I have experience building both iOS Native and cross-platform mobile products using Flutter and Dart. I have contributed to some awesome products and work in cross-functional teams. I have a few of my "play-around" works on Github. 

<br/>

- 🔭 I also busy myself with mentoring candidates who would love to join the programing work force. This serve as a quota of my "pay-back" to the community. And I enjoy every bit of it.⚡⚡⚡


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more open-source projects in the community.

<br/>
