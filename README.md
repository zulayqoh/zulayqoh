- 👋 Hi,<br/> My name is Temi. You can too!🥳
I am a software engineer from Nigeria. I enjoy travelling and living the soft life.
I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I'm learning a lot from the open-source community and love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happens through open-source.

 <br/>
 
- 🌱 I work mostly with Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI and Dart. I have experience building cross-platform mobile products using Flutter and Dart. I have built awesome products and can work in a cross-functional team. I am well versed in web development tools like HTLM, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and MongoDB. I am also a cloud engineer specializing in AWS Cloud Computing. Github serves as a host for the professional projects I've worked on as well as fun projects I'll be handling in order to master new concepts and frameworks.
<br/>

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more open-source projects in the community.

<br/>
